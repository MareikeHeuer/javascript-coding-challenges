Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
and height in meter).
Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
Test data:
§ Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
m tall.

/* Coding Challenge #3
There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each
other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy!
Your tasks:
1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below
2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition,
and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that
as well (draw means they have the same average score)
3. Bonus 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a
team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a
score of at least 100 points. Hint: Use a logical operator to test for minimum
score, as well as multiple else-if blocks 😉
4. Bonus 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when
both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100
points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy

Coding Challenge #4
Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a
restaurant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and
300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.
Your tasks:
1. Calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for
this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement 😅 (If it's easier for you, you can
start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary
operator!)
2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value
(bill + tip). Example: “The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value
316.25”
Test data:
§ Data 1: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430
Hints:
§ To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2
§ Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300 😉

Back to the two gymnastics teams, the Dolphins and the Koalas! There is a new
gymnastics discipline, which works differently.
Each team competes 3 times, and then the average of the 3 scores is calculated (so
one average score per team).
A team only wins if it has at least double the average score of the other team.
Otherwise, no team wins!
Your tasks:
1. Create an arrow function 'calcAverage' to calculate the average of 3 scores
2. Use the function to calculate the average for both teams
3. Create a function 'checkWinner' that takes the average score of each team
as parameters ('avgDolhins' and 'avgKoalas'), and then logs the winner
to the console, together with the victory points, according to the rule above.
Example: "Koalas win (30 vs. 13)"
4. Use the 'checkWinner' function to determine the winner for both Data 1 and
Data 2
5. Ignore draws this time
Test data:
§ Data 1: Dolphins score 44, 23 and 71. Koalas score 65, 54 and 49
§ Data 2: Dolphins score 85, 54 and 41. Koalas score 23, 34 and 27
Hints:
§ To calculate average of 3 values, add them all together and divide by 3
§ To check if number A is at least double number B, check for A >= 2 * B.

Steven is still building his tip calculator, using the same rules as before: Tip 15% of
the bill if the bill value is between 50 and 300, and if the value is different, the tip is
20%.
Your tasks:
1. Write a function 'calcTip' that takes any bill value as an input and returns
the corresponding tip, calculated based on the rules above (you can check out
the code from first tip calculator challenge if you need to). Use the function
type you like the most. Test the function using a bill value of 100
2. And now let's use arrays! So create an array 'bills' containing the test data
below
3. Create an array 'tips' containing the tip value for each bill, calculated from
the function you created before
4. Bonus: Create an array 'total' containing the total values, so the bill + tip
Test data: 125, 555 and 44
Hint: Remember that an array needs a value in each position, and that value can
actually be the returned value of a function! So you can just call a function as array
values (so don't store the tip values in separate variables first, but right in the new
array) */

1. For each of them, create an object with properties for their full name, mass, and
height (Mark Miller and John Smith)

/* Coding Challenge #4
Let's improve Steven's tip calculator even more, this time using loops!
Your tasks:
1. Create an array 'bills' containing all 10 test bill values
2. Create empty arrays for the tips and the totals ('tips' and 'totals')
3. Use the 'calcTip' function we wrote before (no need to repeat) to calculate
tips and total values (bill + tip) for every bill value in the bills array. Use a for
loop to perform the 10 calculations!
Test data: 22, 295, 176, 440, 37, 105, 10, 1100, 86 and 52
Hints: Call ‘calcTip ‘in the loop and use the push method to add values to the
tips and totals arrays 😉
Bonus:
4. Bonus: Write a function 'calcAverage' which takes an array called 'arr' as
an argument. This function calculates the average of all numbers in the given
array. This is a difficult challenge (we haven't done this before)! Here is how to
solve it:
4.1. First, you will need to add up all values in the array. To do the addition,
start by creating a variable 'sum' that starts at 0. Then loop over the
array using a for loop. In each iteration, add the current value to the
'sum' variable. This way, by the end of the loop, you have all values
added together
4.2. To calculate the average, divide the sum you calculated before by the
length of the array (because that's the number of elements)
4.3. Call the function with the 'totals' array

Your tasks:
1. Create one player array for each team (variables 'players1' and
'players2')
2. The first player in any player array is the goalkeeper and the others are field
players. For Bayern Munich (team 1) create one variable ('gk') with the
goalkeeper's name, and one array ('fieldPlayers') with all the remaining 10
field players
3. Create an array 'allPlayers' containing all players of both teams (22
players)
4. During the game, Bayern Munich (team 1) used 3 substitute players. So create a
new array ('players1Final') containing all the original team1 players plus
'Thiago', 'Coutinho' and 'Perisic'

1. Julia found out that the owners of the first and the last two dogs actually have
cats, not dogs! So create a shallow copy of Julia's array, and remove the cat
ages from that copied array (because it's a bad practice to mutate function
parameters)

/* Coding Challenge #2
Let's go back to Julia and Kate's study about dogs. This time, they want to convert
dog ages to human ages and calculate the average age of the dogs in their study.
Your tasks:
Create a function 'calcAverageHumanAge', which accepts an arrays of dog's
ages ('ages'), and does the following things in order:
1. Calculate the dog age in human years using the following formula: if the dog is
<= 2 years old, humanAge = 2 * dogAge. If the dog is > 2 years old,
humanAge = 16 + dogAge * 4
2. Exclude all dogs that are less than 18 human years old (which is the same as
keeping dogs that are at least 18 years old)
3. Calculate the average human age of all adult dogs (you should already know
from other challenges how we calculate averages 😉)
4. Run the function for both test datasets
Test data:
§ Data 1: [5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3]
§ Data 2: [16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4]
*/

/*
const ages1 = [5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3];
const ages2 = [16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4];

  const humanAges = ages.map((age) => (age <= 2 ? 2 * age : 16 + age * 4));
  console.log(humanAges);
  const adultDogs = humanAges.filter((age) => age >= 18);

  );

Rewrite the 'calcAverageHumanAge' function from Challenge #2, but this time
as an arrow function, and using chaining!

/* Coding Challenge #4
Julia and Kate are still studying dogs, and this time they are studying if dogs are
eating too much or too little.
Eating too much means the dog's current food portion is larger than the
recommended portion, and eating too little is the opposite.
Eating an okay amount means the dog's current food portion is within a range 10%
above and 10% below the recommended portion (see hint).
Your tasks:
1. Loop over the 'dogs' array containing dog objects, and for each dog, calculate
the recommended food portion and add it to the object as a new property. Do
not create a new array, simply loop over the array. Forumla:
recommendedFood = weight ** 0.75 * 28. (The result is in grams of
food, and the weight needs to be in kg)
2. Find Sarah's dog and log to the console whether it's eating too much or too
little. Hint: Some dogs have multiple owners, so you first need to find Sarah in
the owners array, and so this one is a bit tricky (on purpose) 🤓
3. Create an array containing all owners of dogs who eat too much
('ownersEatTooMuch') and an array with all owners of dogs who eat too little
('ownersEatTooLittle').
4. Log a string to the console for each array created in 3., like this: "Matilda and
Alice and Bob's dogs eat too much!" and "Sarah and John and Michael's dogs eat
too little!"
5. Log to the console whether there is any dog eating exactly the amount of food
that is recommended (just true or false)
6. Log to the console whether there is any dog eating an okay amount of food
(just true or false)
7. Create an array containing the dogs that are eating an okay amount of food (try
to reuse the condition used in 6.)
8. Create a shallow copy of the 'dogs' array and sort it by recommended food
portion in an ascending order (keep in mind that the portions are inside the
array's objects 😉) */

Your tasks:
1. Use a constructor function to implement a 'Car'. A car has a 'make' and a
'speed' property. The 'speed' property is the current speed of the car in
km/h
2. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 10,
and log the new speed to the console
3. Implement a 'brake' method that will decrease the car's speed by 5, and log
the new speed to the console
4. Create 2 'Car' objects and experiment with calling 'accelerate' and
'brake' multiple times on each of them
Test data:
§ Data car 1: 'BMW' going at 120 km/h
§ Data car 2: 'Mercedes' going at 95 km/h

Coding Challenge #2
Your tasks:
1. Re-create Challenge #1, but this time using an ES6 class (call it 'CarCl')
2. Add a getter called 'speedUS' which returns the current speed in mi/h (divide
by 1.6)
3. Add a setter called 'speedUS' which sets the current speed in mi/h (but
converts it to km/h before storing the value, by multiplying the input by 1.6)
4. Create a new car and experiment with the 'accelerate' and 'brake'
methods, and with the getter and setter.

current battery charge in % ('charge' property)
2. Implement a 'chargeBattery' method which takes an argument
'chargeTo' and sets the battery charge to 'chargeTo'
3. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 20,
and decrease the charge by 1%. Then log a message like this: 'Tesla going at 140
km/h, with a charge of 22%'
4. Create an electric car object and experiment with calling 'accelerate',
'brake' and 'chargeBattery' (charge to 90%). Notice what happens when
you 'accelerate'! Hint: Review the definiton of polymorphism 😉
